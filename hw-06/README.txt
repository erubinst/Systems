2. sort.c - this program reads lines from a file and sorts them in a specific way, either in ASCI-values, numerical, or case insensitive (alphabetical). It can also print the sorted list in reverse if the user enters the flag, -r.  This implements merge sort for the extra credit.  Additionally we used modes to account for the folding and the numerical flag.

sort.h - this is the header file for the sort program.

sort.1 - this is a sample man page of sort, telling you what it is, what it does, and how to use it.

mystrtol.c - this program takes in a line and returns the value of the number in the beginning of the line as a long integer

mystrtol.h - this is the header file for the mystrtol program.  


3. No bugs or incomplete functions. When we run the program sort(), we direct input from a sample textfile (i.e., ./sort < textfile.txt)


4. We think it will take about 7 hours to complete the sorting. The man page and makefile will not take much time, but the sorting programs will take the longest.
It ended up actually taking over 10 hours. It took us a lot of time fixing the sort program because there would be bugs we had to keep fixing. 


5. We affirm that we've adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.

Extra Credit: We used MergeSort instead of the built-in function for our sorting program.
