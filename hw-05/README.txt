2. convertWord.c - this program will use scanf to read in a word from standard input and then convert it to pig latin

pigLatin.c - this program takes in a file and calls convertWord to make each word into into pigLatin

convertWordBack.c - this program will use scanf to find a word from standard input and then converts it from pig latin to English.  It just assumes to take only one letter before words ending with 'ay', that is, epstay will become teps, not step.  This does not consider 'qu' to have to go togther - they will still be separaeted for the reverse translation.

unpigLatin.c - this program takes a file and converts it from pig latin to English

Dialect.c - this program takes in a word and converts it to a made up dialect: for every consonant, add "ong" after it (e.g. hello is hongelonglongo)

otherDialect.c - this program takes in a file by stdin and moves the first three letters to the end, ie: forget becomes getfor

pigLatin.1 - a man page that discusses the pigLatin function: what it does, how to use it
    
unpigLatin.1 - a man page that discusses the unpigLatin function: what it does, how to use it 

3. No bugs or incomplete functions.

4. I estimate it will take us probably around 6-8 hours to complete. It actually took up about 10 hours.

5. I affirm that I have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
