2. A list of programs with a short one-line description of each

hello.c - A program that prints out "Hello, World!" as well as a personalized hello world where it prints out decimal and floating numbers. 

rot128.c - A program that reads in characters, rotates each one by half the allowed range, and writes them out into output; it can also be redirected to an input file and redirect an outout file.
